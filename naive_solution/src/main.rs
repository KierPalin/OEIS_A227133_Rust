/**
 * Author: Kier Palin
 * The unoptimised naive solution to the problem
 *
 * A grid can be represented as a single integer, where each bit represents a tile.
 * This abstracts the problem into a search for the integer with the greatest popcount,
 * Subject to the square rules.
 *
 * Gosper's Hack is an algorithm to generate all integers of a specified popcount.
 * All possible squares that can be formed in the grid can be pre-calculated,
 * They can then be bitwise ANDed with a grid, if the result is equal to the square then,
 * The grid contains that square & hence is invalid.
